# ImageGallery

Hello there! :]
This app is based on Drag&Drop technology and it's mostly for iPad, cause iPad has a Slide Over and/or Split View.

What can ImageGallery do:
- Create, manage and delete photo galleries
- Add pictures from camera or photo library
- Drag & Drop one or several pictures at the same time:
  - from external apps, like Safari, using Split View or Slide Over (only for iPad for now)
  - between galleries (all devices supported)

Using real devices recommended for better performance and more comfortable dragging multiple pictures :]
